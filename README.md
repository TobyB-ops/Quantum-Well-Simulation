Run "PotentialsNew.py" and "HMatNew.py" first, these are the potentials used i.e infinite potential, finite potential, harmonic oscillator, ... etc secondly HMat is the hamiltonian matrix
which solves the hamiltonian matrix using the finite difference method.
Going through the main file each box of code should be run in order, many different settings can be change around for the desired potential / animation / experiment.
